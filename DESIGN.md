## Detailed Technical Specifications

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
- **Atomic Design Methodology**
  - Atoms: Buttons, inputs, icons
  - Molecules: Search bars, filter groups, player cards
  - Organisms: Game cards, player lists, game interfaces
  - Templates: Page layouts
  - Pages: Main application views

#### State Management
- **Redux Store Structure**:
  ```
  {
    app: {
      currentView: 'home' | 'setup' | 'room' | 'game',
      isMobile: boolean
    },
    games: {
      list: [...],
      filters: { ... },
      searchTerm: string
    },
    room: {
      code: string,
      players: [...],
      teams: [...],
      hostId: string,
      settings: { ... },
      status: 'waiting' | 'playing' | 'ended'
    },
    player: {
      id: string,
      name: string,
      teamId: string,
      isHost: boolean,
      deviceId: string
    },
    currentGame: {
      id: string,
      state: { ... },  // Game-specific state
      round: number,
      turnPlayerId: string,
      timeRemaining: number
    }
  }
  ```

#### Responsive Design Approach
- Mobile-first design strategy
- CSS breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 0-640px (default)
  - Tablet: 641-1024px
  - Desktop: 1025px+
- Portrait orientation enforcement for mobile using CSS and JavaScript orientation lock API

### Backend Architecture

#### API Endpoints
- **REST Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/games` - Get list of available games
  - `POST /api/rooms` - Create a new game room
  - `GET /api/rooms/:code` - Get room information
  - `POST /api/ai/content` - Generate game content

#### WebSocket Events
- **Connection Events**:
  - `connect` - Initial connection
  - `disconnect` - Player disconnection
  - `reconnect` - Player reconnection

- **Room Events**:
  - `room:join` - Player joining room
  - `room:leave` - Player leaving room
  - `room:update` - Room state update
  - `room:close` - Room closing

- **Game Events**:
  - `game:start` - Game starting
  - `game:action` - Player action
  - `game:turn` - Turn change
  - `game:round` - Round change
  - `game:end` - Game ending

#### Room Management
- Rooms stored in Redis with 15-minute TTL
- Room code generation using alphanumeric characters (excluding ambiguous characters like O and 0)
- Room cleanup worker runs every 5 minutes to check for abandoned rooms

### Data Models

#### Game Definition
```json
{
  "id": "charades",
  "name": "Charades",
  "description": "Act out a word or phrase without speaking",
  "minPlayers": 4,
  "maxPlayers": 20,
  "duration": 30,
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "categories": ["acting", "party"],
  "teamBased": true,
  "config": {
    "roundsPerTeam": 3,
    "timePerTurn": 60,
    "categoryOptions": [
      {
        "id": "movies",
        "name": "Movies & TV",
        "subcategories": [...]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Room State
```json
{
  "code": "ABCD",
  "gameId": "charades",
  "status": "waiting",
  "createdAt": "2025-03-30T12:00:00Z",
  "lastActivity": "2025-03-30T12:05:00Z",
  "hostId": "player123",
  "settings": {
    "roundsPerTeam": 4,
    "timePerTurn": 45,
    "selectedCategories": [...]
  },
  "players": [
    {
      "id": "player123",
      "name": "John",
      "teamId": "team1",
      "isHost": true,
      "isConnected": true,

    },
    ...
  ],
  "teams": [
    {
      "id": "team1",
      "name": "Team 1",
      "score": 0
    },
    ...
  ],
  "gameState": {
    "round": 1,
    "turn": 0,
    "currentPlayerId": "player123",
    "currentTeamId": "team1",
    "timeRemaining": 45,
    "scores": {...},
    "gameSpecificState": {...}
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations

#### Client-Side Security
- No sensitive game data stored in localStorage or client-side state
- Player roles enforced on server-side
- Rate limiting on joining/creating rooms

#### Session Management
- Device fingerprinting for reconnection
- Short-lived session tokens for authentication
- Cross-tab communication using BroadcastChannel API

### Performance Optimization

#### Network Efficiency
- Minimize WebSocket payload sizes
- Batch updates when possible
- Throttle high-frequency events (e.g., timer updates)

#### Asset Management
- Lazy loading game modules
- Image optimization and caching
- Progressive loading for game lists

## Game Implementation Framework

### Game Module Structure
Each game should be implemented as a module with the following components:

1. **Game Definition** (`gameName.json`)
   - Metadata about the game
   - Configuration options
   - Category definitions

2. **Setup Component** (`GameNameSetup.js`)
   - Game-specific setup UI
   - Settings validation
   - Category selection

3. **Game Controller** (`GameNameController.js`)
   - Game logic implementation
   - State management
   - Round/turn handling

4. **Player Views** (`GameNamePlayerView.js`)
   - Role-specific UI components
   - Action handlers
   - State visualization

### Game Integration Points

1. **Registration**
   - Games must register themselves in the `gameRegistry.js` file
   - Must provide all required metadata and components

2. **Lifecycle Hooks**
   - `onGameStart` - Called when game begins
   - `onRoundStart` - Called at the beginning of each round
   - `onTurnStart` - Called at the beginning of each turn
   - `onPlayerAction` - Called when a player takes an action
   - `onTurnEnd` - Called at the end of each turn
   - `onRoundEnd` - Called at the end of each round
   - `onGameEnd` - Called when game ends

3. **AI Content Integration**
   - Each game defines its content requirements
   - Structured prompts for the AI API
   - Fallback content strategies

## AI Integration Design

### Content Generation Approach
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Cache common prompts and responses
  - Pre-generate content for common categories
  - Implement fallback to pre-written content if API unavailable

- **Prompt Design**:
  - Structured prompts with clear constraints
  - Category and difficulty guidance
  - Format specifications for consistent parsing

### API Usage Optimization
- **Batched Requests**:
  - Generate multiple items in a single request
  - Prefetch likely needed content during setup

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Client-side throttling
  - Graceful degradation on API limits

## Deployment Architecture

                    ↓                       ↓
                [Redis Cache] ⟷ [Background Workers]

                                 [AI API Service]
```

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling for WebSocket servers
- Redis cluster for distributed game state
- Geographic distribution for low latency

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- Feature branch workflow
- Pull request reviews
- Semantic versioning

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for game flows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Mobile device testing matrix

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Real-time game room metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- Game popularity analytics

## Expansion & Maintenance Plan

### Adding New Games
1. Create game module following the standard structure
2. Implement required interfaces and hooks
3. Add game metadata to the registry
4. Test thoroughly with varying player counts
5. Deploy independently from core platform updates

### Platform Updates
- Backwards compatibility for existing games
- Feature flagging for gradual rollouts
- Database migration strategies for schema changes
