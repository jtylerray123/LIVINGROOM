- Basic styling and animation

**Deliverable**: Functional game card component with dummy data.

#### Step 4: Game Data Structure
Define the JSON structure for games. Create a small set of sample game data to test with.

**Deliverable**: Game data schema and 3-5 sample games in JSON format.

⚠️ **Warning**: Design your game data structure to be flexible enough to accommodate various game types while maintaining a consistent format for filtering.

#### Step 5: Game List & Filtering
Implement the game filtering system with:
- Filter by player count
- Filter by duration
- Filter by difficulty
- Filter by genre/type
- Search functionality

**Deliverable**: Functional filter system working with sample game data.

#### Step 6: Game Setup Page
Create the game setup page with:
- Game information display
- Basic settings controls (common across games)
- "Start Game" button

**Deliverable**: Game setup page with basic controls.

### Phase 2: Game Room & Session Management

#### Step 7: Room Code Generation
Implement the room code generation system:
- 4-character unique code generator
- Collision detection for existing rooms
- Basic room creation logic

**Deliverable**: Function to generate unique room codes.

⚠️ **Warning**: Ensure your code generation is truly random and efficiently checks for collisions without performance issues.

#### Step 8: Session Storage
Implement temporary session storage for:
- Player information
- Room information
- Game state

**Deliverable**: Session storage service with appropriate expiration handling.

⚠️ **Warning**: Make sure you properly handle browser refreshes and tab closures. Test thoroughly to ensure state is maintained properly without memory leaks.

#### Step 9: Game Room UI
Create the game room UI with:
- Room code display
- Player list
- Team selection (if needed)
- "Start Game" button for host

**Deliverable**: Game room interface with placeholder data.

#### Step 10: Player Join Flow
Implement the player joining mechanism:
- Code entry validation
- Name input
- Adding to player list

**Deliverable**: Functional player join process.

⚠️ **Warning**: Ensure the join flow is intuitive and handles edge cases (invalid codes, duplicate names, etc.). This is a critical user experience moment.

#### Step 11: Host Controls
Implement host privileges:
- Starting the game
- Removing players
- Host transfer when original host leaves

**Deliverable**: Functional host controls.

#### Step 12: Team Selection
Implement team creation and management:
- Team assignment UI
- Flexible team sizes
- Team switching

**Deliverable**: Team selection and management system.

### Phase 3: Gameplay Framework

#### Step 13: Game Context & State Management
Implement the game state management framework:
- Game context provider
- Player context provider
- Game state transitions

**Deliverable**: State management architecture for games.

⚠️ **Warning**: This is a critical architectural component. Ensure your state management is robust enough to handle the specific needs of various game types without becoming too complex.

#### Step 14: Player Identification & Devices
Implement the player device identification system:
- Device session tracking
- Player role assignment based on device
- Handling multiple tabs/windows

**Deliverable**: Device identification and session tracking system.

#### Step 15: Basic Game Loop
Implement the core game loop framework:
- Round management
- Turn tracking
- Time limiting
- Score tracking

**Deliverable**: Generic game loop that can be extended for specific games.

⚠️ **Warning**: Make sure your game loop is flexible enough to accommodate various game styles while maintaining consistent behavior for shared elements.

#### Step 16: Player Disconnection Handling
Implement player disconnection management:
- Detecting disconnections
- Handling rejoins
- Turn skipping for disconnected players

**Deliverable**: Disconnection and rejoin handling system.

### Phase 4: Game-Specific Implementation

#### Step 17: Game Template
Create a template for adding new games with:
- Required components
- State management requirements
- Player role definitions

**Deliverable**: Documentation and code template for new games.

⚠️ **Warning**: This template will guide all future game development. Make it comprehensive but not overly complex.

#### Step 18: First Game Implementation (e.g., Charades)
Implement your first complete game:
- Game-specific UI for different player roles
- Turn management
- Scoring system
- End-of-game handling

**Deliverable**: Complete implementation of one game.

⚠️ **Warning**: Your first game implementation will likely reveal issues with your overall architecture. Be prepared to refine your framework based on lessons learned.

#### Step 19: AI Integration for Content
Implement AI-powered content generation:
- API integration with Claude or other AI
- Content caching for performance
- Fallback content if AI is unavailable

**Deliverable**: Functional AI content generation system.

⚠️ **Warning**: AI services can be costly and have rate limits. Design your system to minimize API calls and cache results where appropriate.

#### Step 20: End of Game & Play Again
Implement end-of-game handling:
- Results display
- "Play Again" functionality
- "New Game" option
- Team reshuffling between games

**Deliverable**: End-of-game flow and replay options.

### Phase 5: Refinement & Expansion

#### Step 21: Inactivity Management
Implement timeout and inactivity management:
- Game room cleanup after inactivity
- Player turn skipping
- Automatic host transfer

**Deliverable**: Inactivity handling system.

#### Step 22: Second Game Implementation
Add a second game with different mechanics to test the framework's flexibility.

**Deliverable**: Second complete game implementation.

⚠️ **Warning**: The second game should be significantly different from the first to properly test your framework's flexibility.

#### Step 23: Mobile Optimization
Optimize all user interfaces for mobile:
- Touch-friendly controls
- Proper keyboard handling
- Portrait orientation locking

**Deliverable**: Mobile-optimized experience.

#### Step 24: Testing Framework
Implement a testing framework for games to ensure they work correctly:
- Automated tests for common functionality
- Game-specific test cases

**Deliverable**: Testing framework and basic test suite.

#### Step 25: Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation for:
- Adding new games
- System architecture
- Known limitations
- Future enhancement opportunities

**Deliverable**: Complete documentation package.

## Critical Considerations

1. **Performance**: Test with multiple simultaneous game rooms to ensure performance doesn't degrade.

2. **Bandwidth**: Minimize data transfer to keep the app responsive on slower connections.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout to prevent crashes and provide meaningful feedback.

5. **Scalability**: Design your backend to handle growth both in users and in the number of available games.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building your multiplayer game platform. Each step builds on the previous ones, allowing you to test and refine as you go. The warnings highlight critical considerations at each stage to ensure you're building a solid foundation for future expansion.
